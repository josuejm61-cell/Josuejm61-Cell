# Project Scope Statement

## Project Title

Retro Game Archive Website

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a retro gaming archive website that highlights classic video games from the past to the early 2000s. The website I am to make will be like a digital record or library, showcasing essential titles, explaining why they mattered, and showing how gaming has evolved.

I remember that, growing up, I had a lot of games that were hard to come by. Mind you, I was born in 1997, so not that long ago. That is why I chose this project: retro games played a significant role in shaping modern gaming. Plus, it will be nice if I can unlock memories from these games. 

## Project Objectives (SMART)

1. I will try to build and complete a fully functional multi-page website by March 1st or earlier.
    
2. I will include at least 5-10 retro games from different eras (for example: 80s, 90s, early 2000s).
    
3. I will also provide short descriptions, release year, platform, and historical timelines of the games. 
 
## High-Level Requirements

-   A homepage introducing the purpose of the retro archive.
    
-   A games page organized by era or console generation.
    
-   Individual game sections or pages with:
    
    -   Game title
        
    -   Release year
        
    -   Original platform(s)
        
    -   Short description
        
    -   Why the game was significant
        
-   An “About” page explaining the goal of the project.
    
-   Clean, consistent CSS styling.
    
-   Clear navigation between all pages.
    

## Project Deliverables

-   Completed HTML and CSS website.
    
-   At least 8–10 documented retro games.
    
-   Organized file structure.
    
-   Final presentation of the website.
    
-  Scope and Statement sequence is correct and follows project guidelines. 
    

## Boundaries / Exclusions (Out of Scope)

The following features will not be possible or will not be available on the page:

-  This online webpage will not feature any gameplay features.
    
-   No user accounts or login systems.
    
-   No comment sections or forums.
   
## Constraints

**Time:** Must be completed within the semester timeline and follow assignment deadlines.

**Budget:** No financial budget. I will only apply what I have learned in CMPA 1 and CMPA 3

**Resources:** I am to apply my current knowledge of HTML/CSS, course materials, and publicly available research sources.

## Assumptions

-   I will have consistent access to a computer and the internet.
    
-   Information about retro games will be publicly available for research.
   
    
## Acceptance Criteria

The project will be accepted if:

-   All planned pages are completed and linked correctly.
    
-   The layout is consistent and functional.
    
-   There are no primary broken links or formatting issues.
    

## Success Criteria

The project will be successful if the website clearly presents retro games as a historical archive, meets all stated objectives, and follows this scope document as the official baseline throughout
