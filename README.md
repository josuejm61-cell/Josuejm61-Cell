# My Personal Website

This website I developed with Assignment 02 work was to demonstrate my understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals. It presents a styled webpage that includes structured content, external CSS styling, and basic layout techniques to create a visually organized and accessible user experience for me and whoever happens to land on my page.
