# Project Change Request

## Proposed Change

For this specific task by our project manager I will add a Google Map to my Midterm Project website that shows my hometown. I am either going to put it either on the homepage or in the “About Me” section so people can actually see where I’m from and move around the map.

## Reasons for the Change

I am thinking my instructor wants to see us use more real-world features instead of just basic text and pictures. by adding a Google Map it shows how we are able to embed something from another site and make it work inside my webpage. It would make this project more complete and life like. 

## How This Change Will Add Value

This would make the website more interactive and personal. Instead of just reading the name of my hometown, visitors can actually see it on the map and explore it a little. It also shows that I can go beyond the basics and apply what we’ve been learning.

## How This Change Will Affect the Constraints

**Time:** It shouldn’t take too long to add, but I would need some extra time to make sure it looks good and doesn’t mess up the layout.

**Quality:** It should make the site look better and more interesting if I place it correctly. If I don’t format it well, though, it could throw off the design.

**Budget:** There’s no real cost for this since it’s just embedding a map for a school project. The only real “cost” is the extra time I spend adding and adjusting it.
